      <p>
        TEAM Cheffy, we aim to bring opportunities to every people with any
        backgrounds. Because our app supports all different food categories for
        different health conditions, people with special dietary requirements
        can use Cheffy to meet their custom food needs. Plus, We do this by
        empowering local businesses and in turn, generate new ways for people to
        earn, work and live. We started this in 5 states including Washington,
        D.C., Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and with more coming
        soon...
